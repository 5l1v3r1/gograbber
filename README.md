# gograbber
A horizontal and vertical web content enumerator by swarley7 (@swarley777)

# Introduction

`gograbber` is a shitty program I made to solve a number of problems with content enumerators:
 - They only typically work on a single URL
 - They produce poor output
 - Tools that produce screenshots of webpages typically only test `/`
 - Blah
 - Slow

`gograbber` attempts to solve these problems!
- Supply a list of urls, hosts, ip addresses, CIDR ranges, ports, web paths, whatever... and `gograbber` will attempt to discover stuff there.
- Screenshot discovered content! (can be tuned to prevent excessive output)

# TODO
